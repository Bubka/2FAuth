## Reporting Security Issues

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in 2FAuth, please report it through coordinated disclosure.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through the repository issues, discussions, or pull requests.**

Instead, please send an email to contact[at]2fauth.app or open a new [Github security advisory](https://github.com/Bubka/2FAuth/security/advisories/new).

Please include as much of the information listed below as you can to help me better understand and resolve the issue:

* The type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting)
* Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
* The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
* Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
* Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
* Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
* Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help me triage your report more quickly.
